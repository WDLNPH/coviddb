\section{Assumptions}
Show your reasonable Assumptions made in the proposed database design.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every user in our database is a Person. However, for a Person to exist they must be a Patient or a Health Care worker.
    \item A Healthcare worker can be a patient, not mutually exclusive.
    \item Auto-incrementing identifiers for our entities avoids user input which eliminates the possibility of errors of having multiple instance of an entity with the same ID.
    \item Our database system will be used to cover Canada and it's region/cities.
    \item Our data focuses on Quebec.
    \item Regions, GroupZones, and Recommendation do not need a delete call in CRUD.
\end{itemize}
